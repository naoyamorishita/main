# Basic mathematics revealed forest dynamics in MA.
This will be presented at NEARC Conference on 21st May, 2024 by Naoya Morishita.
This presentation summarizes a chapter of the presenter's master thesis, submitted to Clark University.

## 0. Summary
1. I only used mathematical division, subtraction and local Moran's I for this research to make sure methods are clear for everyone.
2. I identified clusters of high change intensities and quantity intensity of non- forest in central MA and Martha's Vineyard, not east MA.
3. Future studies should focus on other land covers that affect connectivity among habitats.

## 1. Introduction
- Massachusetts, especially east MA, experienced forest loss and fragmentation (Blumstein & Thompson, 2015; Rogan, et al., 2016).
    - There are few studies examined the fragmentation and losses between 2 time points.
- Also, researchers developed a lot of cool tech.
    - However, it is hard to explain and explain.

## 2. Data
- [Land cover from NOAA](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional.html)
    - Time point of 2006 (TP06)
    - Time point of 2016 (TP16)
- Municipaity boundary from [MassGIS](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-municipalities)

## 3. Methods
### 3.1 Workflow Image
![Work Flow](./imgs/nearc_imgs/slide3.png)

### 3.2 What is foreground area intensity (FAD)?
FAD is a part of GuidoToolbox (Vogt & Riitters, 2017), and it examines forest fragmentation using a moving window.
I used the moving window of size of 24km^2, which is close to American black bears' home range (Klamath Inventory & Monitoring Network, 2021).
If a center pixel is forest, then the FAD is calculated and the value is assigned to the center pixel. 
FAD is calculated as **FAD = Number of foreground pixels/ Number of total pixels in the moving window.**
If the FAD is less than 60%, then the pixel is called fragmented forest (FF). If not, then the pixel is called non- fragmented forest (NFF).
If a center pixel is not forest, then the value is background, which is called non- forest(NFF).
See [this documentation](https://ies-ows.jrc.ec.europa.eu/gtb/GTB/psheets/GTB-Fragmentation-FADFOS.pdf) for the detail.

### 3.3 What is change metrics?
We compared two maps at the TP06 and TP16 using some of the metrices presented by Pontius Jr. (2022).

#### 3.3.1 Terminologies in This Research
- Extent: The number of pixels in a study area which is area of each municipality.
- Category size of a category *k*: The number of pixels of *k* at a time point in the extent.
- Losses of a category *k*: Pixels that were *k* at TP06, but not *k* at TP16.
- Gains of a category *k*: Pixcels that were not *k* at TP06, but *k* at TP16.
- Change: Pixels whose categories were different between the time points.
    - The study compared 2 time points' maps, so this is NOT change.
        - A pixel belonged to category *k* at TP06.
        - The pixel changed to another category, and then changed back to the original category *k* by TP16.

#### 3.3.2 Category Intensity & Change Intensity
We calculated the gain intensity and the loss intensity for each category, in addition to the change intensity for municipality.
- Loss intensity = **Loss size/ Category size at TP06**
- Gain intensity = **Gain size/ Category size at TP16**
- Change intensity = **Change size/ Extent size**

#### 3.3.4 Quantity Intensity of a Category
Quantity, also called net change, excludes simultaneous gains and losses of a category.
It is impossible that one category in the extent have both positive loss quantity and positive gain quantity.
- Loss quantity = MAXIMUM(Loss size - Gain size, 0)
    - **Loss quantity intensity = Loss quantity/ Category size at TP06**
- Gain Quantity = MAXIMUM(Gain size - Loss size, 0)
    - **Gain quantity intensity = Gain quantity/ Category size at TP16**

### 3.4 What is local Moran's I?
I identified clusters containing significantly similar values with neighbors at 5% alpha, as well as spatial outliers (Mitchel, 2009).
Then, comparing with the attribute values, the clusters are labeled either high or low (Mitchel, 2009).
Note that the "high" and "low" are relative to the mean value (Anselin, 2020).

See [this webpage](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-cluster-and-outlier-analysis-anselin-local-m.htm) for the detail.

## 4. Result & Discussion
1. Non- forest showed the largest cluster of high intensities of gains in central and western Massachusetts. 
    - Western Mass also showed a high cluster of losses
    - Central Mass shows both high clusters of gains and losses of fragmented forest.
        - These areas experienced high intensities both of gains and losses.

2.	Change intensity shows high clusters in central Mass in Martha's Vineyard
    - Nonetheless, Worcester, the 2nd populated city in MA was a spatial outlier.
        - This implies its significantly dissimilar value.

3. Net change intensity, in other words quantity intensity in the western areas was high cluster of loss non- forest. 
    - This indicates that their losses were larger than their gains. 
    - Central Mass showed quantity gain intensities of both fragmented forest and non- forest.

From these 3 points, I would conclude that **central Mass had been the most subjective to change**. Unlike discussion by previous studies, **the outskirts of Bosto and Worcester were low clusters or spatial outlier in the high clustersof the change intensity and non- forest gain quantity**. This may indicate that its forest change dynamics may no longer be intensive in the area than others. That may make sense if these areas have been already developed enough.

## 5. Potential Research Questions in the Future
1. How other land cover changed in municipalities? This is because the land cover differently affects behavior of wildlife.
2. What are potential drivers behind the forest dynamics? One possible driver that I discussed with my supervisor is solar panel installations that typically occurred in central Mass  (Tao, Rogan, Ye, & Geron, 2023).
3. How do parameters affect the model? For example, what if we change queen contiguity weights into distance- based weights when we do local Moranâ€™s I?
4. How do the fragmentation and losses affect behavior of the bears in reality? A study revealed increase of nocturnal activity of bears in MA due to urban development (Zeller, Wattles, Bauder, & Destefano, 2020).
