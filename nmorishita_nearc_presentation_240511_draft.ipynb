    "1. I only used mathematical division, subtraction, and local Moran's I to keep simplify methods.\n",
    "2. I identified clusters of high change intensity and gain quantity intensity of non- forest in central MA, not east MA.\n",
    "3. Future studies should focus on other land covers that affect connectivity among habitats."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "- Massachusetts, especially east MA, experienced forest loss and fragmentation (Blumstein & Thompson, 2015; Rogan, et al., 2016).\n",
    "    - There are few studies compared COMBINEDLY forest connectivity and area changes between 2 time points.\n",
    "- Also, researchers developed a lot of cool tech.\n",
    "    - However, it is hard to explain and explain.\n",
